# Auto Crop Analyzer

<p>Auto Crop Analyzer is a product under the company <b>BIGBLARE INNOVATIONS LLP</b>. I had the task of interfacing the IoT devices used with the Raspberry Pi.
  <br>
  This product is basically used to find the conditioning of the crop. The parameters that are considered for analyzing the crop are:<br>
  -  Age<br>
  -  Pesticide Abuse<br>
  -  Chemical Abuse <br>
</p>

<p>
  The product is still under the patent filling procudre. So the disclosure of the SoP can not be displayed.
